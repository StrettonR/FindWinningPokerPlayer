# FindWinningPokerPlayer

This C# project evaluates two poker hands and determines the winner based on standard poker hand rankings. The project was developed as part of an interview coding test, and it showcases the decision-making and code structuring approaches used to solve the problem.

Project Description
In poker, a hand consists of five cards and is ranked according to the following hierarchy (from lowest to highest):

High Card: The highest single card.
One Pair: Two cards of the same value.
Two Pairs: Two different pairs.
Three of a Kind: Three cards of the same value.
Straight: Five consecutive cards of different suits.
Flush: Five cards of the same suit, not in sequence.
Full House: Three of a kind combined with a pair.
Four of a Kind: Four cards of the same value.
Straight Flush: Five consecutive cards of the same suit.
Royal Flush: A, K, Q, J, 10 of the same suit.

The program compares two hands and outputs which one is the winner based on these rankings. If both hands have the same ranking, the highest cards are compared to break the tie.
